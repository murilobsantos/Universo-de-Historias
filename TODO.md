# TODO: Fix Environment Variable and Connection Issues

## Issues Identified
- Environment variable not being loaded properly: dotenv is loaded in server.js, but path might be incorrect or .env not present.
- Connection timing issue: Using setTimeout(2000) as a hack after connectDB, which is unnecessary since connectDB is async.
- Server restart needed: Normal for environment variables, but ensure proper loading.

## Plan
- [x] Update backend/server.js to remove setTimeout and ensure proper async handling.
- [x] Add logging to verify environment variables are loaded.
- [ ] Improve database connection to handle timing properly.
- [ ] Test server startup and connection.

## Dependent Files
- backend/server.js
- backend/config/database.js

## Followup Steps
- Run the backend server and check logs for connection success.
- Verify API endpoints work without timing issues.
- If issues persist, check .env file contents manually.
